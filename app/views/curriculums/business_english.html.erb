                <h2><strong>How to write a Job Description</strong></h2><br>
                <strong>Job title</strong><br><br>

                <strong>Make your job titles specific. </strong>Targeted job titles are more effective than generic ones, so be precise by <br> including key phrases that accurately describe the role. <br>
                <strong>Avoid internal lingo that may confuse the job seeker.</strong>Stick to standard experience levels like “Senior” rather than “VI” or other terms <br> people are less likely to look for. <br>
                <strong>Keep the job title concise.</strong>Our data shows job descriptions that are 80 characters or less receive more clicks. <br>
                <strong>Research popular job titles. </strong>Use Indeed Job Trends, a free tool, to compare the popularity of job titles and phrases within job postings.  <br>

                <h2><strong>Job summary</strong></h2><br><br>
                <strong>Open with a strong, attention-grabbing summary. </strong>Your summary should provide an overview of your company and expectations for the position. <br>
                <strong>Hook your reader with details about what makes your company unique.  </strong>Your job description is an introduction to your company and your employer brand. <br> Include details about your company culture to sum up why a candidate would love to work for you. <br>
                <strong>Include an exact job location.</strong>Provide an exact job location to optimize your job posting so it appears higher in job search results.  <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Responsibilities and duties</strong></h2><br>

                <strong>Outline the core responsibilities of the position. </strong>Make sure your list of responsibilities is detailed but concise. Also emphasize the duties that <br> may be unique to your organization. For example, if you are hiring for <br> an “Event Management” role and the position requires social media expertise to promote events, include <br> this detail to ensure candidates understand the requirements and can determine if they’re qualified. <br>

                <strong>Highlight the day-to-day activities of the position. </strong>This will help candidates understand the work environment and the activities they will be exposed to on a daily basis.  <br>This level of detail will help the candidate determine if the role and company are a right fit, helping you attract the best candidates for your position. <br>

                <strong>Specify how the position fits into the organization. </strong>Indicate who the job reports to and how the person will function within your organization, helping candidates <br>see the bigger picture and understand how the role impacts the business.  <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Qualifications and skills</strong></h2><br>

                <strong>Include a list of hard and soft skills. </strong> Of course, the job description should specify education, previous job experience, certifications and technical skills required for the role.  <br>You may also include soft skills, like communication and problem solving, as well as personality traits that you envision for a successful hire. <br>

                <strong>Keep your list concise. </strong>While you may be tempted to list out every requirement you envision for your ideal hire, including too many qualifications <br> and skills could dissuade potential candidates. <br><br>

                <strong>Speaking Matters</strong><br><br>

                <strong>Ashley: </strong>What is the best way to find a job here? <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>There are different ways of conducting a job search. Do you know what <br>you want to do? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I don't know. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Can you work part-time or full-time? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>It doesn't matter right now, either one would be OK. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs <br>lists are good too. <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>OK, I'll go check it out. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information. <br> Would that work for you? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I am not sure. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Everything that you need for a successful job search is here. <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Make sure that you understand the company. Do you understand what it is that they do? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>No, I probably need to do some more research. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy <br> or kind of more relaxed. Does that make sense? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I think that their attitude is rather casual. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear. Do you have something to wear? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong> I have absolutely nothing so far. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, but can we talk about other basics? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>Yes, where should we go from here? <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Focus on being relaxed and open, don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what <br> their company is about. I'm sure you'll do well. <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>What should I do to prepare for a job interview? <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it <br> provides is essential. Do you have that?<br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>Sort of, but I could know more, I guess. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>With that understanding, you can figure out what your company is looking for in <br> terms of basic attitude. Right? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I think that they are a very formal company. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>What you wear is important. So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and <br> type of work you will be doing. Need help? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>I need a lot of help in this area. <br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics, OK? <br>
                <strong>Ashley: </strong>Yes, what else should we think of?<br>
                <strong>Brian: </strong>Be prompt. Don't forget to be friendly and interested. Listen carefully and listen <br> to what they are really asking you. You'll be a hit!<br><br>

                <strong>Presenter: </strong>Today we are talking to Philip Knight about the structure of Biopaints International. <br> Philip is the General Manager of the Perth factory. Philip, do you think you <br> could tell us something about the way Biopaints is actually organized?<br>
                <strong>Philip:: </strong>Yes, certainly. We employ about two thousand people in all in two different locations. <br>Most people work here at tour headquarters plant. And this is where we have the <br> administrative departments, of course. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>Well, perhaps you could say something about the departmental structure? <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>Yes, certainly. Well, now first of all, as you know we've got two factories,  <br>one here in Perth,Australia, and the other in Singapore.John Weber is the other <br>General Manager, over there in Singapore. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>And you are completely independent of each other, is that right? <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>Oh, yes. Our two plants are fairly independent. I mean, I am responsible to George Harris, <br>the Production Manager, and we have to co-operate closely with Rosemary Broom, the Marketing Manager. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>hmmm , yes. <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>But otherwise, as far as day to day running is concerned, we're pretty much left alone to get on with the job. <br> Oh, and I forgot to mention finance. The Finance Director is Weimin Tan. <br>She's a very important woman. And her task is to make sure the money side of things is OK. <br> The accountant and such people, they report to her directly. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>Is that all? <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>Oh, no, no. There's Personnel too. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>Oh, yes. <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>That's quite separate. Deirdre Spencer is Personnel Manager. And the Training Manager <br> reports to her, of course. <br>
                <strong>Presenter: </strong>Are there any other features worth mentioning? <br>
                <strong>Philip: </strong>There's the planning department—Brian Jones is in charge of that. And a purchasing department—they <br> buy in the materials for production. <br><br>

            <em>Interview with Claire Bebbington, External Affairs Manager for a division of British Petroleum.</em><br><br>


            <strong>Interviewer: </strong>Why should companies be ethical or what are the advantages of a company in behaving ethically? <br>

            <strong>Claire: </strong>Mmm, I think the whole issue of ethics is a very complex one. Companies are made up of people. Multinationals are made <br> up of many different nationalities. I think that companies are part of society and as such they should <br> reflect society's standards. Companies, especially multinational ones, do have <br> responsibilities in the world and should try to be positive influence and I think <br> if a company is not ethical, then it will not survive as a company.<br>
            <strong>Interviewer: </strong>Should a company have a code of ethics? <br>
            <strong>Claire: </strong>I think, from my point of view, it's useful on two counts. Firstly, it makes a commitment to certain good behavior <br> and so it's a way of communicating the importance of good behavior to all of its employees and partners. <br> Secondly, if a company has a code of ethics and spends time communicating it, <br> it does actually contribute to its ethical behavior. If you express these things in writing, especially, <br> then you can be held accountable for them. This tends to mean that you are much more likely to act on them as well. <br>I think following up that code is difficult. People tend to have different ethical standards, and defining the term 'ethics' <br> can be a problem. But I think generally to express what your ethics are is a positive thing to do. <br>
            <strong>Interviewer: </strong>What kinds of moral dilemmas do large companies face? Can you think of any examples? <br>

            <strong>Claire: </strong>I think if you were to look at any company's ethical code, you would usually find in it a section about <br> offering bribes and this can be an area where people can get themselves into hot water. <br> Facilitation payments are part of doing business in many countries, and bribes are something which most companies are <br>not going to want to get involved in. But when does a facilitation payment become a bribe? And that is a <br> question that can be quite difficult to answer. <br><br>

          <h3>Speaking Matters</h3><br><br>

         <strong>Listen and Repeat:</strong><br><br>


         <strong>New Employee (NE): </strong>So, what are the working hours? <br>
         <strong>Colleague (C): </strong> Well, we’ve got flexible time here, but you must work a total of seven hours. <br>
        <em>So if you start at 9am, you can finish at 5pm. You mustn’t start work later than 10am.</em> <br><br>

        <strong>NE: </strong>Which name do I use with colleagues and bosses? <br>
        <strong>C: </strong>You’re allowed to use first names with colleagues and family names with our bosses. <br>
        <em>It is different in other departments, so you have to ask to be sure.</em><br><br>

        <strong>NE: </strong>Is there a dress code at the company? <br>
        <strong>C: </strong>The company rules say you have to wear a suit for important meetings. Otherwise, you should just dress casually. <br>
        <strong>NE: </strong>When can I have lunch? <br>
        <strong>C: </strong>You can have lunch between 11am and 1.30pm. I suggest 11.30am or 1pm because the canteen is always crowded between <br> 12 noon and 1pm. You don’t have to eat there. We’ve got several good restaurants <br> and sandwich shops nearby. <br>
        <strong>NE: </strong>Where can I park? <br>
        <strong>C: </strong>In the underground car park. You mustn’t park directly in front of the office. This is reserved for customers. <br>
        <strong>NE: </strong>Who can help me if I’ve got a problem? <br>
        <strong>C: </strong>You should speak to me first. I’ll try to help you. I don’t think you should speak to the boss first. <br>

        <p>Debra Jones the CEO has instructed John Weber her Vice President of Marketing to take a business trip. He is going to meet with <br> some clients and with various representatives from MC Sports.</p><br>


        <strong>Debra Jones: </strong>Hello John, I would like to talk with you in my office today. It’s about the business trip <br> that I have asked you to go. <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>I’m ready today to present to you about the business trip plan. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>Excellent, let’s discuss about it then. <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>Here are the flight details, I have purchased a round trip ticket for my trip. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>How about your hotel reservations? <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>I booked for a single adult, non-smoking room within a reasonable distance (5 - 10 miles) of the city I’m visiting , <br> since Sporting Goods Unlimited has a policy in place that limits the expense for a hotel room to $150 per night. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>What about your transportation? <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>I’m planning to take mid-size or economy car but not a flashy sports car of course. Because our company <br> has a policy in place that limits the expense for a rental car to $100 per day. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>What your plan about the client dinner meeting? Typical business dinner takes place at a more upscale restaurant. <br>

        <strong>John: </strong>I have chosen an appropriate and convenient restaurant for the dinner meeting.  The price, atmosphere, <br> and menu selections are great there. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>What’s your plan on the two non-business days there? I’m pretty sure it’s going  to be awesome; however, <br> you need to look at the weather report first. <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>Thanks for asking Debra. If the weather is fine I will visit two attractions during my trip. The cost of <br> these visits will not be part of my business trip expenses. I have allotted some from my own pocket. <br>
        <strong>Debra: </strong>I think all is set for your trip, please keep in touch and I’ll see you next week. <br>
        <strong>John: </strong>Sure will, thank you for this opportunity. I’ll see you next week. <br><br>

          <h3>Sentence Patterns</h3><br>

          <p>In Pattern No. 3, the subject comes before a linking verb and its complement. Recall from Chapter 2 that common linking verbs are am, is, <br> are, was, were, be, being, and been. Other linking verbs express the senses: feels, appears, tastes, sounds, seems, looks. <br> A complement is a noun, pronoun, or adjective that renames or describes the subject. A complement completes the meaning of the subject and always follows the linking verb.</p><br><br>

        <strong>R: </strong>Hi there. Are you checking out now? <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>Yes, sorry. I know we're a few minutes late. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>That's no problem. It's always really busy at check out time anyway. <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>Oh, really. The last hotel we stayed in charged us for a late check out. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>The hotel isn't booked this week, so it's not a problem. How was everything? <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>The room was great. The beds were really comfortable, and we weren't expecting our own fridge. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>I'm glad you liked it. <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>We were disappointed that the pool wasn't open this morning, though. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>I apologize for that. We can't get a cleaner in any earlier than 10 am. <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>Well we had a nice swim last night anyhow. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>Will you be putting this on your credit card? <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>No. I'll pay cash. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>OK. So the total comes to$356.78, including tax. <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>I thought it was $256.78 even. That's what they said  when we checked in. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>Yes, but there is an extra room charge on your bill. <br>
        <strong>JW: </strong>Oh, I forgot. I ordered a plate of nachos. Sorry about that. <br>
        <strong>R: </strong>No problem. Here's your change. Now, I'll just need to ask you for your room keys. <br><br>


        <strong>Questions:</strong><br><br>
        <p>1. How much is the room total cost? <br>
          2. What is the extra cost for? <br>
